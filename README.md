## Project1:
- This project uses AWS CLI to perform EC2 instance related tasks and a bash script to minimize the time it takes for developers to deploy rails code.
Script is based on [Deploy guide by Gorails](https://gorails.com/deploy/ubuntu/22.04)

## Project2:
- The second project is deploying a Docker image on Amazon ECS cluster.
Docker Image pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/bhavyansh001/contained_rails)
The rails application lives [here](https://github.com/bhavyansh001/contained_rails) (uses branch `main` for ECS deployment)
